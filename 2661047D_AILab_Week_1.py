# 
# #### What you expect to learn from the course?
# <li>An introduction in how to code AI so that it is realistic for me to persue.</li>
# <li>The history of AI and what makes AI, this understanding can then become applicable to modern day code.</li>
# <li>Better my writing abilities and improve how I write about code in essays and referencing Figures.</li>
# <li>To be able to create my own programs that I can apply to daily life or help me work or research in the future.</li>
